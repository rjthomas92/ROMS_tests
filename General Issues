Regarding Roms_tools:
  - When creating the roms_grd.nc there seems to be an issue with the drivers only when NOT editing the landmask. A libGL error finding the driver persists.
  Choosing to edit the landmask will allow the grid to be created as normal.
  - Errors with differences in the vtransform/vstretching variables cause an issue when running roms with the created grid. These variables that are chosen 
  in the make_grid.m file are also used by the ocean.in file to run ROMS and should agree. 
  - The romstools_param.m file contains the base grid and variables for the make files. These should be created with the same parameters. Changing the 
  parameters for one will require EACH make file to be recreated.
  - The create_inifile.m file from romstools hard sets Vstretching=1. To fix issues with non compatibility, I have added the vstretching variable to the 
  create_inifile to be read from romstools_param
    { create_inifile.m : added extra vstretching term in input parameters and refer to it at the end of the definitions. }
    { make_ini.m : added vstretching pulled from parameters to input variables of create_inifile.m. }
