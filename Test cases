Just a quick note here. When running the DAMEE_4 test case, the model ran into an issue with Vtransform and Vstretching. Perhaps this is the result of the test 
case not being fully supported but either way a configuration of Vtransform and Vstretching of 1 instead of the default 2 seemed to work.
* After looking into this, it seems like it has to do with the vertical coordinate overhaul for ROMS (notes can be found https://www.myroms.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=1233)
* Initially for ROMS, a value of 1 for Vtransform and Vstretching were used, this was later changed to 2. We can change these values back to 1 or reconfigure the 
* Netcdf files (I'm not sure how to do this yet so I'll just change it for now).
# As of the time of this edit, the DAMEE_4 test case has been running for about 13 hours (using romsS) so it might be worth adjusting the time 
# scale for this next time I want to run it, I didn't look too deeply into this initially and slighly regretting not.
