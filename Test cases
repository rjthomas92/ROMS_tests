# Now for the more complicated/realistic test cases

Just a quick note here. When running the DAMEE_4 test case, the model ran into an issue with Vtransform and Vstretching. Perhaps this is the result of the test 
case not being fully supported but either way a configuration of Vtransform and Vstretching of 1 instead of the default 2 seemed to work.
* After looking into this, it seems like it has to do with the vertical coordinate overhaul for ROMS (notes can be found https://www.myroms.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=1233)
* Initially for ROMS, a value of 1 for Vtransform and Vstretching were used, this was later changed to 2. We can change these values back to 1 or reconfigure the 
* Netcdf files (I'm not sure how to do this yet so I'll just change it for now).
# As of the time of this edit, the DAMEE_4 test case has been running for about 13 hours (using romsS) so it might be worth adjusting the time 
# scale for this next time I want to run it, I didn't look too deeply into this initially and slighly regretting not.
# It ended up taking ~16hrs. Not terrible I suppose.

After coming back to this some time later, the compilation was having issues with a few things. Initially it was struggling to find the mpif.h
file but this was fixed once I changed from using openmpi to mpif90 as my parallel tool. I'm thinking the reason for this might be that mpif90 was 
able to find the required files easier since it was running f90 applications but I'm not sure why openmpi stopped working for me after  being perfectly fine 
for so long.
The second issue I ran into was an issue with the netcdf library. This wasn't an issue with my laptop so I'm not sure if it was jkust a build issue or what. 
Editing the Linux-gfortran.mk file fixed this as once I changed the line:
  LIBS += $(shell ${NF_CONFIG} --flibs) to
  LIBS += -L/etc/NetCDF/c/lib -L/etc/NetCDF/fortran/lib -lnetcdff -lnetcdf
the compilation worked fine. We'll see how the model runs with this later today.
